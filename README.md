# Applied Multi-Factor Regression Analysis on the Milton Friedman Dataset

One of my favorite projects at San Jose State University is the Historical Milton Friedman Data Analysis Project. 
This project was a group project that involved myself working with a group of individuals in the second semester 
Applied Statistics course at San Jose State University. While this was a group project, the data cleaning and analysis was done by myself. 
The project consisted of aquiring the dataset and subsetting the observations to the most current year to get the most 
consistent amount of non-empty values. Afterwards, the entries that still had empty values in their remaining features had 
their aggregated values used as a substitute. Afterwards, the deleniation between developed and developing countries was 
included into the dataset for 2006 (as that feature had originally been ommited), which lead to a fascninating discovery. 
After appropraite outlier removal and statistical testing, a very strong multifactor linear correlation was found between 
the average number of procedures to start a buisness and GDP per capita between developed and developing countries. 
Essentially, the more procedures to start a buisness, the less GDP per capita the country had.
